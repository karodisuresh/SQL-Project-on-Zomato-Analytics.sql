#INTRODUCTION

*/
SQL stands for Structured Query Language.
It is the standard language to interact with databases. SQL is the most important tool,
a data analyst uses to manipulate and gain insights from the data. In this project, we will try to process,
and analyze the data, for this purpose we will use this Zomato Datasets from.

#1 Creating Zomato Table Script

So now after creating the database let’s start exploring the data and answer some questions.

#2. PROCESSING THE DATA

So let’s have a look at our data set, to see the data we will use this query:

Q1 — — what is total amount each customer spent on zomato ?

Q2-- How many days has each customer visited zomato?

Q3--what was the first product purchased by each customer?

Q4 — — what is most purchased item on menu & how many times was it purchased by all customers ?

Q5 — — which item was most popular for each customer?

Q6 — — which item was purchased first by customer after they become a member ?
